## GitHub

Relojban is an open source project maintained by a community of volunteers. The [Relojban GitHub project](https://github.com/relojban/) is the central point for all development activities.

There are currently two main repositories:

- **[relojban-book](https://github.com/relojban/relojban-book/)**: the source files for _The Relojban Language_.
- **[rfcs](https://github.com/relojban/rfcs/)**: for the RFC process used to submit proposals for Relojban.

Feel free to explore the repositories, file issues, or send pull requests!

## Mailing List

If you are interested in participating in discussions in or about Relojban, there is a general mailing list hosted by [Groups.io](https://groups.io). The archives are public and are available [here](https://relojban.groups.io/g/relojban/topics).

To **subscribe** to the mailing list, send an email to `relojban+subscribe@relojban.groups.io`.

To **send a message** to the mailing list, send to `relojban@relojban.groups.io`.

To **unsubscribe**, send an email to `relojban+unsubscribe@relojban.groups.io`.

For further information, send an email to `relojban+help@relojban.groups.io`.

You can participate to the mailing list also in "web forum" mode by going to the [Relojban page at Groups.io](https://relojban.groups.io/), if you are so inclined. Access via web is optional, though. Having an account at groups.io or using the web interface is in no way required to join the mailing list.

Note that if you subscribe to the mailing list, you will have fine-grained control on the messages that you will receive or not receive. You will also have the possibility to join subgroups that host discussions of more specific topics, such as the `dev` subgroup (subscribe address: `dev+subscribe@relojban.group.io`) dedicated to the design and development of the language.
