      <p>
      Lojban (pronounced <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">LOZH-bahn</span>”</span>) is a constructed language. Previous versions of the language were called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Loglan</span>”</span> by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955.
    </p>
      <p>
      It would not make justice to Loglan/Lojban to summarize here in a few words their rich and interesting history, which spans more than 60 years across the two projects. To get an understanding of how they developed, growing from a research project to an incredibly sophisticated language suitable for real-life use, the interested reader is invited to peruse the trove of information available at the Lojban website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.lojban.org" target="_top">http://www.lojban.org</a>).
    </p>
      <p><a id="id-1.3.2.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>
      Among thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the best-known), Loglan/Lojban stands out because it has features that make it unique in several ways:

      Relojban is a derivative of Lojban. Its goals are in line with those of Lojban, except that Relojban places particular emphasis on the following aspects:
    </p>
      <div class="bullets"><ul class="bullets" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Standardization. The Relojban project focuses on providing complete specifications of the language, suitable for unambiguos implementation through software parsers, and supporting an ecosystem of diverse software tools. It also makes an effort to provide and maintain reference implementations of the language specifications.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Stability, but with the possibility of future evolution. At the current stage the Relojban language is open to a certain level of experimentation, but the project highly values the idea of long term stability and of a careful, planned approach in response to future pressure for change. However, even in the long term, the Relojban project does not envisage to ever reach a "final", immutable state of the language. The objective is, on the contrary, to continuously allow refinements and adjustments, if warranted and justified, through well-defined processes.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>
      Relojban is intended to be a community effort. The content of this book and of all other online resources related to Relojban are open for contributions by interested users, so that the language and its description can be continuously improved and refined.

      This book is the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">reference grammar</span>”</span> of the Relojban language. It is derived from <em class="citetitle">The Complete Lojban Language</em> by John Woldemar Cowan (the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">CLL</span>”</span>, as it is colloquially known). In fact, for the most part the book is a copy of the CLL, as only the parts where the Relojban vision diverged from Lojban were adjusted or rewritten (the reader will readily recognize the rewritten parts by their poor style compared to Cowan's prose). In practice, only <a class="xref" href="chapter-phonology.html" title="Chapter 3. Phonology: Relojban Sounds and Syllables">Chapter 3</a>, <a class="xref" href="chapter-morphology.html" title="Chapter 4. Morphology: The Shape of Relojban Words">Chapter 4</a>, <a class="xref" href="chapter-connectives.html" title="Chapter 14. The Relojban Connective System">Chapter 14</a>, <a class="xref" href="chapter-quantifiers.html" title="Chapter 16. Relojban And Logic">Chapter 16</a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Relojban Formal Specifications">Chapter 21</a> have been subject to a more extensive redrafting.
    </p>
      <p>
      By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For every rule in the formal Relojban grammar (given in <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Relojban Formal Specifications">Chapter 21</a>), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, <a class="xref" href="chapter-tour.html" title="Chapter 2. A Quick Tour of Relojban Grammar">Chapter 2</a> gives a brief overview of the language, <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Relojban Formal Specifications">Chapter 21</a> gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put semantic flesh on those formal bones.

      <p>
      Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.
    </p>
      <p><a id="id-1.3.5.3.1" class="indexterm"></a>
      The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on the self-same sentences:
    </p>
      <div class="example"><a id="example-random-id-hrtj"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 1.1. 
          <a id="id-1.3.5.4.1.1" class="indexterm"></a>
        </strong></p><div class="example-contents">
        
        <div class="informaltable"><table>
          <colgroup></colgroup>
          <tr class="jbo">
            <td>mi</td>
            <td>klama</td>
            <td>lo</td>
            <td>zarci</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="gloss">
            <td>I</td>
            <td>go-to</td>
            <td>a/the</td>
            <td>store.</td>
          </tr>
        </table></div>
        <div class="informaltable"><table>
          <tr class="para">
            <td colspan="99">
              <p class="natlang">I go to the store.</p>

      will become wearisomely familiar before <a class="xref" href="chapter-grammars.html" title="Chapter 21. Relojban Formal Specifications">Chapter 21</a> is reached. This method is deliberate; the book uses simple and (eventually) familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not a textbook. Rather, it is intended both for self-learning and to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.
    </p>
      <p>
      It is useful to talk further about <a class="xref" href="chapter-about.html#example-random-id-hrtj" title="Example 1.1. ">Example 1.1</a> for what it illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The first of these is in Relojban (in italics), the second is a word-by-word literal translation of the Relojban into English (in boldface), and the third is in colloquial English. The second and third lines are sometimes called the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">literal translation</span>”</span> and the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">colloquial translation</span>”</span> respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one or both are omitted. If there is more than one Relojban sentence, it generally means that they have the same meaning.
    </p>
      <p>
      Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Relojban texts, these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional translations of specific Relojban words, but don't have exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In <a class="xref" href="chapter-phonology.html" title="Chapter 3. Phonology: Relojban Sounds and Syllables">Chapter 3</a>, square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
    </p>
      <p>
      Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Relojban words discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE Relojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are explained in context.
    </p>
      <p><a id="id-1.3.5.9.1" class="indexterm"></a>
      A few Relojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are explained in <a class="xref" href="chapter-tour.html" title="Chapter 2. A Quick Tour of Relojban Grammar">Chapter 2</a>, except for a few used only in single chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those chapters.
